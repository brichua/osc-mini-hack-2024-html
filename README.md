README

For the purposes of this hackathon, Organization Instagrams are preloaded and premanipulated by GPT3.5-Turbo.
Future use would have owners of Student Org accounts opt-in to the service, where the program would consistently pull and update from its database of approved student org Instagrams to update GatORGanizer's database of posts and content. 

For the current state of our product, there is no setup involved aside from launching the URL. Intended functionality is search bar would display recommended Orgs based on filtered tags, an infinite scrolling discover page for orgs, each org having their own landing page (or thin rectangle), and the ability to subscribe to specific interested orgs to appear on your feed and have it auto populate onto the embedded Calendar.
